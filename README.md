# Hi, I'm Martin! 👋

Data Engineer by day, aspiring Software Engineer by night. I am interested in programming, data science, biology, cycling & the outdoors. I started off my career in a lab-based role in biotech, however, my continued interest and passion for data analytics and programming allowed me to pursue a career in Tech. I am currently plying my trade at Specialized, where I help build and maintain the data infrastructure that facilitates insightful reporting and data analysis. I do so by creating and maintaining data pipelines, expanding and looking after the data warehouse, as well as helping the business translate analytics needs into concrete engineering requirements.
